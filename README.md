### 3D Rendering

*Rendering* is the process of generating a 2D image from 3D data. An image is composed of an array of rectangular dots called *pixels*. 

The data containing information about 

* colors
* lights
* geometry

is processed by the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to produce an image on the screen.
